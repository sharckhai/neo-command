1. Executive Summary
The Core Insight
During observership at Lurie's Children's Hospital (Level III NICU), we observed that
coordination, not clinical knowledge, is the bottleneck in maternal-neonatal emergency
transport. A constellation of 12+ specialists surrounds every complex case, each contributing
domain expertise that must be synthesized into actionable decisions.
This multidisciplinary coordination exists at Level III academic medical centers but is absent in
rural/Level II facilities where most babies are born. The knowledge gap contributes directly to
maternal mortality disparities.

The Solution

NeoCommand is a multi-agent AI system that:
1.​ Learns from Level III multidisciplinary coordination patterns
2.​ Simulates specialist consultation in real-time (12+ agents debating like real specialists)
3.​ Synthesizes complex input into clear recommendations
4.​ Transfers knowledge from academic centers to rural providers who need it most

The Innovation: Simulation Observatory
Before deploying to real clinical scenarios, we're building a Simulation Observatory where:
●​
●​
●​
●​

Real specialists observe AI agents debating anonymized cases
Specialists validate whether AI reasoning matches clinical reality
Specialists maintain authority - they approve/override every decision
The system learns from specialist feedback in a controlled research environment

This is not automation. This is knowledge democratization with human oversight.

What We Observed
Central Care Nucleus:
●​
●​
●​
●​
●​
●​

Mother
Father
Newborn Infant
Kristen (Head Nurse/Charge Coordinator)
Hospital Director
Assigned Nurses

Surrounding Specialist Ring (15+ disciplines):

●​
●​
●​
●​
●​
●​
●​

Surgical: Surgeon, Obstetrician Surgeon
Cardiac/Pulmonary: Cardiology, Pulmonology
Neurological: Neurology
Metabolic/Endocrine: Nephrology, Endocrinology
Hematology/Oncology: Hematology, Oncology
Immunology/Rheumatology: Immunology, Rheumatology
Other Specialists: Urology, Dermatology, Ophthalmology

Neonatal Transport Technicians
Critical Care Nurses
NICU Medical Directors

Emergency Response Coordinators
Air Ambulance Operators
Dispatch Centers
Insurance & Reimbursement Agencies
Hospital Legal & Compliance
Local & Federal Health Authorities

The Coordination Pattern
"I tried to map the conversations but couldn't - because everyone was talking to
everyone simultaneously. It was already multi-agent coordination, just happening
with human specialists."
Key Observations:
1.​ No linear hierarchy - specialists coordinate peer-to-peer with overlapping conversations
2.​ Head nurse/coordinator role - someone (like Kristen) listens to all input, takes notes,
synthesizes
3.​ Domain expertise clusters - specialists defer to each other in specialized areas
4.​ Real-time debate - conflicts are surfaced and resolved through discussion, not authority
5.​ Clinical continuity - same team manages prenatal → delivery → postpartum → NICU
6.​ Team scaling - complexity drives team size: 7-14 people depending on severity

2.2 The Rural Reality: The Gap
Level II/Rural Hospitals:

●​
●​
●​
●​
●​

❌ No specialist constellation
❌ Generalist OB + Pediatrician at best
❌ Nurse often makes decisions alone
❌ No clinical continuity across care phases
❌ "Transfer if complex" is only option

When Transfer Needed:
●​
●​
●​
●​

Weather may prevent air transport
Helicopter may be down for maintenance
Distance creates time pressure
Coordination happens via phone tag (20-40 minutes vs. 4 seconds)

Result:
●​
●​
●​
●​

Higher maternal mortality in rural areas
Delayed access to specialty care
Suboptimal decision-making under uncertainty
Fragmented care coordination

2.3 The Coordination Bottleneck
From transport professional interviews:
"The challenge here is learning the logistics... The medicine becomes easy after a
while."
The hard problem is NOT clinical knowledge. It's:
●​
●​
●​
●​
●​
●​

Knowing who to call
What buttons to push
Which facility has what capability
How to coordinate across 7-14 people
How to synthesize conflicting input
How to make decisions under incomplete information

This is the white space NeoCommand enters.

Human maintains final authority (not automation)

Principle 2: Transparency Over Black Box
●​
●​
●​
●​

Full specialist conversation is always accessible
Reasoning is explainable at every step
Confidence scores show certainty levels
Conflicts are surfaced, not hidden

Principle 3: Learn from the Best, Serve the Rest
●​
●​
●​
●​

Train on Level III coordination patterns
Deploy to Level II/rural facilities
Knowledge flows from academic centers to where it's needed
Creates equity without requiring specialist presence

Principle 4: Specialists Retain Authority
●​
●​
●​
●​

System recommends, humans decide
Specialists can override any recommendation
System learns from overrides
Creates human-AI collaboration, not replacement

<a name="simulation-observatory"></a>

4. The Simulation Observatory
4.1 Concept: Research Before Deployment
Before deploying NeoCommand in live clinical scenarios, we build a Simulation Observatory
where:
Real specialists observe AI agents debating real (anonymized) cases
Think of it as:

●​
●​
●​
●​

Netflix for clinical decision-making - specialists watch episodes at their own pace
Research validation tool - does AI reasoning match how specialists would coordinate?
Training dataset generator - specialist feedback improves the system
Trust-building mechanism - specialists see the reasoning before trusting
recommendations

5.3 Agent Reasoning Framework
Each agent follows this evaluation pattern:
def evaluate_situation(self, case_data, context):
"""
Each specialist evaluates from their domain expertise
"""
# 1. ASSESS from domain perspective
assessment = self.analyze_clinical_data(case_data)

# 2. IDENTIFY concerns from specialty lens
concerns = self.identify_risks_and_issues(assessment)
# 3. FORMULATE recommendation
recommendation = self.generate_recommendation(
assessment,
concerns,
context # What other specialists have said
)
# 4. SURFACE trade-offs
tradeoffs = self.identify_tradeoffs(recommendation)
# 5. EXPRESS in role-appropriate language
return {
'speaker': self.profile['name'],
'role': self.profile['role'],
'assessment': assessment,
'concerns': concerns,
'recommendation': recommendation,
'tradeoffs': tradeoffs,
'confidence': self.calculate_confidence(),
'defer_to': self.identify_dependencies() # Other specialists whose input affects mine
}

<a name="head-coordinator"></a>

6. Head Coordinator Logic
6.1 The "Kristen" Agent
The Head Coordinator is modeled after the charge nurse/head coordinator role observed at
Lurie's. This agent:
●​
●​
●​
●​
●​

Listens to ALL specialist input
Takes structured notes
Identifies conflicts
Synthesizes coherent recommendations
Maintains human-in-loop authority

6.2 Note-Taking Structure
class HeadCoordinator:
def __init__(self):
self.notes = {
'clinical_requirements': {
'maternal': [],
'neonatal': [],
'dyad': []
},
'transport_constraints': {
'assets': [],
'timing': [],
'weather': [],
'equipment': []
},
'risk_factors': {
'maternal': [],
'neonatal': [],
'transport': [],
'coordination': []
},
'stakeholder_preferences': {
'clinical_optimal': [],
'family_centered': [],
'safety_first': [],
'time_critical': []
},
'conflicts_identified': []
}

Example: Note-Taking During Debate
Agent speaks: Dr. Chen (OB)
Input: "Hemorrhage ~1200ml, fundus firm, vaginal laceration,
needs MFM surgical expertise we don't have here"
Head Coordinator categorizes:
→ clinical_requirements['maternal'].append({
'need': 'MFM surgical capability',
'urgency': 'high',
'local_capability': 'no',
'speaker': 'Dr. Chen (OB)'
})

────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Agent speaks: James (Flight Nurse)
Input: "Weight 864 lbs, H135 capacity 750 lbs, we're over by 114"
Head Coordinator categorizes:
→ transport_constraints['equipment'].append({
'constraint': 'H135 weight exceeded',
'impact': 'Cannot transport both patients on H135',
'magnitude': '114 lbs over',
'speaker': 'James (Flight Nurse)'
})
→ conflicts_identified.append({
'conflict': 'Speed vs Capacity',
'option_a': 'H135 fast but weight problem',
'option_b': 'H145 capable but delayed',
'speakers': ['Maria (Transport)', 'James (Flight Nurse)']
})

6.3 Synthesis Algorithm
def synthesize_recommendation(self, all_specialist_input):
"""
After hearing from all specialists, create coherent plan
"""
# 1. CATEGORIZE all input
self.categorize_specialist_input(all_specialist_input)
# 2. IDENTIFY conflicts and trade-offs
conflicts = self.identify_conflicts()
# 3. WEIGH competing priorities
priority_weights = self.calculate_priority_weights(
clinical_urgency=self.assess_clinical_urgency(),
safety_margins=self.assess_safety_margins(),
family_impact=self.assess_family_impact(),
resource_constraints=self.assess_constraints()
)
# 4. RESOLVE conflicts using clinical judgment heuristics

resolution = self.resolve_conflicts(conflicts, priority_weights)
# 5. BUILD recommendation
recommendation = self.construct_recommendation(resolution)
# 6. CALCULATE confidence
confidence = self.calculate_confidence_score(
specialist_agreement=self.measure_agreement(),
data_completeness=self.assess_data_quality(),
historical_similarity=self.find_similar_cases()
)
# 7. GENERATE rationale
rationale = self.generate_rationale(
recommendation,
conflicts,
resolution,
specialist_input
)
return {
'recommendation': recommendation,
'confidence': confidence,
'rationale': rationale,
'risk_mitigation': self.identify_contingencies(),
'specialist_consensus': self.summarize_agreement(),
'dissenting_views': self.highlight_disagreements()
}

Conflict Resolution Heuristics
When specialists disagree, Head Coordinator applies:
1. Clinical Safety First
IF any specialist raises critical safety concern
THEN that concern overrides efficiency/speed considerations
UNLESS another specialist provides evidence that safety concern is mitigated

2. Specialty Deference
WHEN conflict is within a specialist's primary domain
THEN weight that specialist's input more heavily

EXAMPLE: MFM opinion on maternal hemorrhage > generalist OB opinion

3. Consensus Building
WHEN >70% of relevant specialists agree
THEN high confidence in that direction
WHEN 50-70% agreement
THEN moderate confidence, surface trade-offs clearly
WHEN <50% agreement
THEN flag as requiring human judgment, present multiple viable options

4. Time-Critical Tiebreaking
WHEN time is critical (maternal/neonatal deterioration)
AND conflict exists between "optimal" and "fast enough"
THEN favor "fast enough with acceptable safety margins"
BECAUSE perfect can be enemy of good in emergency medicine

5. Family-Centered Care Preference
WHEN clinical outcomes are similar between options
AND one option better preserves mother-child dyad
THEN favor keeping dyad together
UNLESS safety margins are unacceptable

7. Research & Validation Protocol
7.1 The Research Question
Can AI agents, trained on Level III coordination patterns, provide clinically valid
multidisciplinary input that specialists would trust and approve?

Sub-questions:
1.​ Do AI agents reason about cases like real specialists do?
2.​ When AI and human specialists disagree, why?

3.​ What does AI miss that humans catch?
4.​ What does AI surface that humans might miss?
5.​ Would specialists approve AI recommendations in real scenarios?

7.2 Validation Metrics
Agreement Metrics
Primary:
●​ Recommendation Agreement Rate: % of cases where AI final recommendation
matches specialist consensus
○​ Target: >80%
Secondary:
●​ Specialist-Level Agreement: For each specialist agent, % agreement with real
specialist in that role
○​ Example: Virtual MFM agrees with real MFM specialist 85% of time
●​ Trade-off Identification: Does AI identify the same conflicts real specialists would?
○​ Measured by specialist annotation: "Yes, this is the key trade-off" vs "AI missed
the real issue"

Quality Metrics
Critical Miss Rate:
●​ % of cases where AI fails to identify a major risk that specialists catch
●​ Target: <5%
False Alarm Rate:
●​ % of cases where AI raises concern that specialists deem irrelevant
●​ Target: <15%
Novel Insight Rate:
●​ % of cases where AI surfaces a consideration that specialists find valuable but hadn't
initially considered
●​ Target: >10%

Trust Metrics
Approval Rate:

●​ If this were real: % of specialists who would approve AI recommendation
●​ Target: >75%
Override Rate:
●​ % of cases where specialist would override AI recommendation
●​ Track reasons for override (builds training data)
Explanation Quality:
●​ Likert scale: "The AI's rationale was clear and clinically sound"
●​ Target: >4.0/5.0

7.3 Data Collection Protocol
For Each Simulation:
Specialist provides:
1.​ Pre-simulation assessment:​
○​ "Given this clinical scenario, what would you recommend?"
○​ Captured before seeing AI debate
2.​ During simulation:​
○​ Annotations at key decision points
○​ "Agree/Disagree" markers on specific agent statements
○​ Comments on missing considerations
3.​ Post-simulation:​
○​
○​
○​
○​

Final approval/override decision
Rationale if overriding
Confidence in AI recommendation (1-5 scale)
Open-ended feedback

System captures:
●​
●​
●​
●​

All specialist annotations
Timestamp of when specialists pause/replay sections
Which agents' input specialists re-watch
Discussion threads in peer chat

Qualitative Feedback:
Monthly interviews with 5-10 specialist observers:

●​
●​
●​
●​

"What cases made you most uncomfortable with AI reasoning?"
"Where did AI surprise you positively?"
"What's missing from the specialist agents?"
"Would you use this in your practice?"

Example Learning Loop:
Case #023: Specialists consistently override AI recommendation
Analysis reveals:
●​ AI recommended H145 (slower but capable)
●​ Specialists preferred H135 with separation
●​ Reason: "Mother's bleeding rate suggests we have less time than AI calculated"
Learning:
●​ AI's hemorrhage rate calculation was conservative
●​ Update clinical knowledge base with more nuanced bleeding assessment
●​ Adjust time-critical heuristics to be more aggressive when bleeding active
Re-run:
●​ Updated AI now recommends H135 with separation
●​ Specialists agree: "Now AI is thinking like I would"

8.3 Data Flow: One Simulation
1. Specialist selects Case #047 in Observatory
2. Frontend requests simulation via WebSocket
→ POST /api/simulation/run
→ { case_id: "047", observer_id: "dr_kim_mfm" }
3. Backend loads case data
→ Clinical scenario (maternal + neonatal status)
→ Available resources (facilities, transport, weather)
→ Outcome data (for post-simulation reveal)
4. Simulation Engine initializes agents
→ Create 12 specialist agent instances
→ Load relevant knowledge for each
→ Initialize head coordinator

5. Multi-agent debate begins
→ Each agent evaluates case independently
→ Head coordinator aggregates input
→ Agents respond to each other
→ Conflicts surface
→ Synthesis emerges
6. Real-time streaming to frontend
→ Each agent statement sent as it's generated
→ Frontend visualizes bubbles speaking
→ Specialist observer sees debate unfold
7. Head coordinator synthesis
→ Final recommendation generated
→ Confidence score calculated
→ Rationale constructed
8. Frontend presents to specialist
→ "Would you approve this recommendation?"
→ Specialist provides feedback
9. Feedback stored
→ Agreement/disagreement logged
→ Comments captured
→ Used for next learning iteration

Time: 11:47 PM, Friday
Weather: Snow, deteriorating conditions
MATERNAL STATUS:
- Postpartum hemorrhage, ~1200ml estimated blood loss
- Delivered 32-week infant 45 minutes ago
- Fundus firm, active vaginal bleeding
- Appears to be deep vaginal laceration beyond local repair capability

- Vitals: BP 108/62, HR 102, RR 18, O2 sat 98% on RA
- Alert and anxious

• H135 helicopter: Burlington, 18-minute flight
• H145 helicopter: Lebanon, 42-minute flight
• Ground ambulance: 90 minutes to Boston General
- Weather: Snow increasing, 30-minute safe flying window
- Receiving facility: Boston General (Level IV maternal, Level III NICU)
All teams available

Specialist Agent Debate (Abbreviated)
Dr. Sarah Chen (OB/GYN, Sending): "28-year-old with approximately 1200ml blood loss
postpartum. Fundus is firm, so this isn't uterine atony. I can visualize what appears to be a deep
vaginal sidewall laceration - it's actively bleeding and beyond what I'm comfortable repairing
here. She needs MFM surgical expertise. We've got two large-bore IVs, she's responding to
fluid resuscitation, vitals are holding for now, but this bleeding isn't going to stop without surgical
repair. She needs to get to a facility with MFM capability."
Sarah Williams (L&D Nurse, Sending): "Current vitals: BP 108/62, HR 102. She's maintaining
blood pressure with fluid resuscitation. We've run through about 1500ml of LR. She's alert,
anxious about the baby. Baby is currently skin-to-skin which she really wants. Patient is asking
to stay with the baby. We have limited blood products here - maybe 4 units total in our blood
bank."
Dr. Michael Patel (Pediatrician, Sending): "This is a 32-week infant - technically viable but
really at the edge for our facility. Apgars are good, currently stable on room air, but we need to
remember this is a 32-weeker. If she develops respiratory distress, we don't have the capability
to manage it properly. She needs Level III NICU observation at minimum. The fact that she's
stable right now is good, but 32-weekers can decompensate."

Maria Torres (Transport Coordinator): "Okay, assets available: H135 out of Burlington can be
there in 18 minutes flight time. H145 out of Lebanon would be 42 minutes. Ground ambulance
would be 90 minutes to Boston General. Weather update: we've got snow moving in, I'm being
told we have maybe a 30-minute window where flying conditions are good, after that it's going to
be marginal at best."
James Mitchell (Flight Nurse): "Let me run the numbers on the H135 - mother at 240 pounds,
baby at 4 pounds, we need full maternal monitoring equipment that's about 85 pounds, neonatal
isolette and support is 120 pounds, crew is 350 pounds, fuel for the trip is 65 pounds. That puts
us at 864 pounds. H135 capacity is 750 pounds. We're 114 pounds over capacity. We cannot
safely put both patients on the H135. The H145 has capacity for 1100 pounds so we'd be fine on
that aircraft, but that's the 42-minute timeline."
Captain Martinez (Pilot): "Weather update - snow is increasing, ceiling is dropping. I can make
the H135 flight right now, no problem. The H145 in 42 minutes though, we're going to be right at
the edge of safe flying conditions. I can do it, but it's not comfortable. If we're going to do the
H145, we need to commit right now because that weather window is closing."
Dr. Jennifer Kim (MFM Specialist, Receiving): "From the MFM perspective, we can absolutely
handle this laceration repair. It sounds like a vaginal sidewall - we do these all the time. We'll
have OR ready, blood bank has products standing by. My main concern here is the mother-baby
dyad. Separating them right after delivery, especially with a premature infant, creates significant
psychological stress. There's good evidence that keeping mother and baby together, especially
for breastfeeding initiation and maternal-infant bonding, is important. If we can keep them
together, that would be optimal from a family-centered care perspective."
Dr. David Washington (Neonatologist, Receiving): "We're ready for a 32-weeker in our Level
III NICU. Standard 32-week protocols. I agree with Dr. Kim - keeping mom and baby together is
ideal if we can do it safely. But if the baby needs to come separately, we can handle it. The
clinical urgency for the baby is lower than for the mother - she's stable right now. The
time-to-care issue is more critical for the maternal bleeding."
Lisa Chen (NICU Manager, Receiving): "We have bed availability in the Level III pod. Staffing
is appropriate - we've got a 2:1 nurse-to-patient ratio available. We're ready to receive. 32-week
protocols are standard for us."
Dr. Rodriguez (Anesthesiologist, Receiving): "OR #3 can be ready. If she needs to go
straight to OR for the repair, we can have the team assembled in 15 minutes. Anesthetic risk is
acceptable - she's young, healthy, responsive to resuscitation."
Tom Anderson (Blood Bank, Receiving): "We have 4 units O-negative ready to go,
cross-match will be done by the time they arrive. If we need massive transfusion protocol, we
can escalate, but it doesn't sound like that's where we're at right now."
Jennifer Park (OR Scheduler, Receiving): "OR #3 is available, can be prepped and staffed.
Just need a 15-minute heads-up for the full team to assemble."

Head Coordinator Synthesis
Notes Taken:
Clinical Requirements:
●​ Maternal: MFM surgical capability needed (vaginal laceration repair)
●​ Neonatal: Level III NICU minimum (32-week protocols)
●​ Preference: Keep mother-baby dyad together if safely possible
Transport Constraints:
●​
●​
●​
●​

H135: Fast (18 min) but weight capacity exceeded by 114 lbs
H145: Capable (1100 lb capacity) but delayed (42 min)
Weather: 30-minute safe window, deteriorating
Ground: 90 min, less affected by weather

Risk Factors:
●​
●​
●​
●​

Maternal hemorrhage ongoing (though currently stable)
Weather window closing
Separation trauma if split transport
Neonatal decompensation possible (though stable now)

Conflicts Identified:
●​ Speed (H135, 18 min) vs. Capacity (H145, 42 min)
●​ Keeping dyad together vs. getting mother to care fastest
●​ Weather safety vs. optimal aircraft selection
Final Recommendation:
RECOMMENDED ACTION:
Deploy H145 from Lebanon immediately
Transport mother + baby together
Expected arrival: 42 minutes
Weather window: Sufficient if dispatch NOW
CONFIDENCE: 78%
RATIONALE:
1. Maternal stability supports 24-minute delay
- Vitals stable with fluid resuscitation (BP 108/62, HR 102)
- Bleeding active but not catastrophic
- Dr. Chen reports patient hemodynamically stable

2. Family-centered care priority
- Strong preference from Dr. Kim (MFM) to keep dyad together
- Psychological benefit of maternal-infant bonding
- Supports breastfeeding initiation
- Reduces family stress during crisis
3. H145 provides full capability
- Both patients accommodated safely
- Complete equipment configuration
- No compromises on monitoring or care
4. Weather window acceptable
- Capt. Martinez confirms doable if we commit now
- Marginal but within safety parameters
RISK MITIGATION:
- If maternal condition worsens en route:
Ground ambulance staged at midpoint for emergency landing/transfer
- If weather deteriorates faster than predicted:
Alternate landing sites identified
Ground backup coordinated
- Receiving facility preparation:
OR #3 prepped and staffed
Blood products ready (4 units O-neg, more available)
MFM and NICU teams coordinated for simultaneous arrival
SPECIALIST CONSENSUS:
12/12 specialists consulted
Strong support from MFM (Dr. Kim) and NICU (Dr. Washington) for keeping dyad together
Transport coordinator (Maria) and pilot (Capt. Martinez) confirm feasibility
No strong dissenting views
ALTERNATIVE CONSIDERED:
H135 with mother-baby separation
- Faster for baby (18 min vs 42 min)
- Mother via ground (90 min)
- Rejected due to: family impact, coordination complexity, mother's time-critical need

Specialist Observer Feedback (Example)
Dr. Kim (Real MFM Specialist watching simulation):

✅ APPROVE recommendation

"I completely agree with this reasoning. The 24-minute delay is acceptable given her current
stability, and keeping the dyad together is really important here. The AI correctly weighted the
family-centered care consideration, which I appreciate. The risk mitigation around weather and
having ground backup staged shows good contingency planning. I would make this exact same
recommendation."
Confidence: 5/5 Comments: "The virtual MFM agent reasoned very similarly to how I would.
Good job identifying the key trade-off and resolving it appropriately."
