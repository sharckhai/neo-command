VF Agent - Comprehensive Question Reference
This document consolidates all questions the VF Agent is designed to answer, organized by category.
MoSCoW Definitions
MoSCoW is an industry standard for defining feature requirements. Here is what they mean for this project for each question.
Must Have: the agent must reliably handle this case. 
Should Have: the agent should be able to handle this case, but we need to build prototypes to confirm this is possible.
Could Have: the agent might be able to handle this case; major prototyping is required to determine feasibility.
Won’t Have: the agent will not handle this case because development effort outweighs the value of the question.
Agent Component Glossary
Supervisor Agent: Simple router that recognizes intent and delegates user queries to the appropriate sub-agents.
Genie Chat: Databricks text to SQL agent that supports converting plaintext english questions into SQL queries.
Geospatial Calculation: non-standard geospatial calculations e.g. geodesic distance.
Medical Reasoning Agent: a reasoning agent with medical expertise. It will add context, modify user queries, or perform reasoning on results returned by other agents. 
External Data: data that is not currently in the Foundational Data Refresh (FDR). This data will be added to the Virtue Foundation workspace or queried in real-time. 
Vector Search with Filtering: semantic lookup on plaintext fields in addition to metadata-based filtering.
Unknown: the ideal architecture for this question has unknowns and needs a research spike.
